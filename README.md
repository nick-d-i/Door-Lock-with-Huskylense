# üîê Face Recognition Smart Lock with HuskyLens and Arduino

This project is a face recognition-based smart lock system using the [HuskyLens AI Camera](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1922.html) and Arduino. It recognizes specific faces and unlocks a relay (e.g. door lock) only when authorized users are detected.
